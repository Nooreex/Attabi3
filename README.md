A project aims to create my first website.
The idea of website is: giving opportunity for users to learn how to type faster in Arabic langauge using the keyboard.
The expected time of releasing to public is June 2018.
The steps to be executed:
- come up with the idea.
- choosing a name for the website.
- create a logo.
- collecting resources.
- designing a frame work.
- build it using HTML & CSS.
- involve other langauges as javascript & php.
- make the website more responsive and light weight and simple.
- buy a domain.
- upload the files.
- publishing and promote through social media.

I am still beginner in web designing so suggestions are all accepted.
